=== What this is 
This is my simple attempt at an interoperability tool between Git
and Monticello. It is specifically tailored at inter operating 
between GNU Smalltalk and Squeak/Pharo (as those are the only 
Smalltalks I know of which use one of these two version control 
systems). However, I try to keep the code specific to either 
Smalltalk fairly separate, so the code might be pretty easily 
adaptable to other uses. I just didn't see any.

==== The Squeak Code 
The project is "self-hosting" and has been almost right-away.
The Squeak side consists of a Git wrapper, a Package-to-Filesystem
mapper and a "Registry" class which keeps track of the settings 
and Git-enabled packages in the system and is used as the command 
interface for Gitocello. For GNU Smalltalk interoperability I have
included a GstPackageWriter class that creates a 'package.xml' file
from the Monticello package information.

==== The GNU Smalltalk "Code" 
The GST side for now is only a post-receive hook written in bash
that creates a new Monticello package from the last commit and
only with the last commit message. This is mainly for simplicity,
but also because the project is not meant to be used in both
directions, but rather to support porting efforts and keeping ports
up-to-date.
